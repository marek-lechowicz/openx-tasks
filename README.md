## Task 1
I guess I have to look at other sites sellers.json files, but the problem is that some companies have them hosted on other domains than the one specified in "domain: " field, so I don't know how to automatically get whole supply chain. I tried also finding supply how to get SupplyChain object, sadly my effort was fruitless.

## Task 2
By default script if written to act like specified, meaning it uses current date taken from system.
To test your own current date e.g. the one given in the .pdf file you should modify line 133.
